# What needs to be done

1. [A Proposed Model](https://github.com/CasperLabs/Governance/wiki/A-proposed-Governance-Model)
2. Figure out how community developers are incentivized and compensated for their work: [Project Page](https://github.com/CasperLabs/Governance/projects/1):
  Options:
   * GitCoin
   * Internally administered by community
3. Figure out the process to name the chain.  Obtain candidates, get consensus
4. CBC-Casper Economic parameters:
  * Bond amounts - Min and Max
  * Unbonding wait period
  * Transaction fee holding period.  How long should Tx fees be held before being paid out?  Fees will be paid out as new blocks are proposed on top of the block in question.
